# Preserving Planetary Life Support Capabilities

The purpose of this repository is to organize and present ideas on how
to prevent sudden, irreversible changes in Earth's biosphere that
could significantly degrade the planet's life-supporting capabilities.

**The original submitter of this repository believes this issue is urgent.**

The most suitable theoretical framework for this work currently
identified is the "Planetary Boundaries" concept from the Stockholm
Resilience Centre and the Australian National University.
(**Suggestions for improvement are welcome**)

Let us examine the most urgent issues:

## Nitrogen Cycle

> As a result of extensive cultivation of legumes (particularly soy,
alfalfa, and clover), growing use of the Haber–Bosch process
in the production of chemical fertilizers, and pollution emitted
by vehicles and industrial plants, human beings have more than
doubled the annual transfer of nitrogen into biologically available
forms.

> Increasing levels of nitrogen deposition are shown to have a number
of negative effects on both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.

**TODO:** The original submitter of this repository does not understand
planetary nitrogen cycle at all and neither why it is considered by Planetary
Boundaries Framework as the most urgent issue. **Help is needed here.**

## Radiative Forcing of Climate

Excess radiative forcing refers to the imbalance between the energy Earth
receives from the Sun and the energy it radiates back into space. This
imbalance is primarily driven by human activities, particularly the emission
of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous
oxide (N2O), which trap heat in the atmosphere.

It is likely that the world could reach or exceed the +1.5°C threshold
sometime between the early 2030s and the early 2040s, if current emission
trajectories continue.

Crossing a +1.5°C anomaly in global temperature relative to pre-industrial
levels is a critical threshold in the context of climate change and tipping
points. Tipping points refer to thresholds in the Earth’s climate system that,
once crossed, could lead to significant and potentially irreversible changes
in the environment. These changes could have cascading effects, leading
to further warming and destabilization of the climate system.

### Causes

**TODO**: The World in Data, what drives excess radiative forcing 

**TODO**: The World in Data, CO2 per sector

### Pillars of solution

We have no time to build nuclear, we have to act fast.

#### Massive renewables, distributed storage, smart grid

**TODO**: Get, read and summarize here the article
